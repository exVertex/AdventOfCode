# Advent Of Code

Initially, this was a project where my AoC solutions were stored. With time, it evolved into a tiny framework that makes solving the puzzles a bit faster, and the presentation of the puzzle results clean and unified. 


## Set-up
<em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) installed on your device.</em>
1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal and run `dotent run` at root.
    - If you run the command without any arguments, it will get the result of the latest puzzle.
    - If you run the command with YYYY DD arguments, it will get the result for AoC puzzle from year YYYY and day DD.
      (ex. `dotent run 2022 05` will get you the result for AoC puzzle from year 2022, day 5.)
